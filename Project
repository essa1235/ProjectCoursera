# # Exploring Data Science Techniques

# Data science is an interdisciplinary field that combines scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It encompasses various techniques and tools that enable us to uncover patterns, make predictions, and derive valuable information from data.
# 
# In this notebook, we will delve into the world of data science, exploring different languages, libraries, and tools commonly used in the field. We will also cover fundamental concepts such as arithmetic expressions and data manipulation. Through hands-on exercises, we aim to provide a practical understanding of key data science techniques.
# 
# Join us on this journey to unlock the power of data and gain insights that drive informed decision-making. Let's dive into the exciting realm of data science and uncover the endless possibilities it offers!

# Arithmetic Expression Examples:
# In mathematics, arithmetic expressions are used to perform calculations. They can involve operators such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). Here are some examples of arithmetic expressions:
# 
# 1. Addition: 2 + 3 = 5
# 2. Subtraction: 10 - 4 = 6
# 3. Multiplication: 5 * 6 = 30
# 4. Division: 12 / 3 = 4
# 
# These are basic examples, and arithmetic expressions can be more complex, involving parentheses and multiple operations.

# In[7]:


a = 2
b = 3
multiply_result = a * b
add_result = a + b

print("Multiplication Result:", multiply_result)
print("Addition Result:", add_result)


# In[8]:


minutes = 150
hours = minutes / 60

print("Hours:", hours)
